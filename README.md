<h1 align='center'>Customer Interaction Journey Optimization using Machine Learning and Meta-Heuristic Algorithms</h1>

**Customer Interaction Journey Optimization using Machine Learning and Meta-Heuristic Algorithms** suggests a way to identify opportunities related to markeing each of a business's products, also considering the products already subscribed, if any, by a customer. Various key factors which help in determining the opportunity are selected. Attributes which could derive these factors are engineered. The likelihood of increase or decrease in these key factors on selling varous products to a customer is forecasted using predictive modeling techniques trained individually to predict each of such likelihood. A weighted aggregate of the predictions made by multiple ML models will be used to determine the opportunities. Metaheuristic algorithm is used to derive a near-optimal journey which maximizes the overall opportunity of the company with the customer.<br><br>
